# DCAITI Project: Street damage detection and rating
Supervisor: Dr. Witzke, Marcus
Affiliation: Daimler Center for Automotive IT Innovations, Technical University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany.

# Overview of the project
1.Labeled and augmented the collected data(GRDDC and ZEB
datasets).

2.Trained YOLOv5 Model with transfer learning and Detected damage
on ZEB image dataset.

3.Defined scoring model according to the detection results, with labels
from shapefile.
- Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression, Particle
Swarm Optimization(PSO).

See detail on the presentation slide and paper; programming part in branch master.
